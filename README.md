# Cedar Rapids Area Homeschools

## IT Club Cyber Defense, 2022-2023 season

The initial purpose of this repository will be to hold meeting notes. As the season progresses, we may put source code in here, or solutions to problems we work on, or anything else we think will be valuable to the team as a whole.

## Topics for the remainder of the year

The competition is on April 22nd, and we have chosen to follow a two-year plan. That means we are in the part of the year where we have to speed up and get through as many of the following topics as we can.

Here is the list. It is not in priority order at this point.

1. A deeper look at object permissions
   - we talked about this a bit already
2. Finish notes on ssh server/client configuration
   - we talked about this a bit already
3. ~~Installing, configuring, and controlling services~~ (will be covered as part of *Focus on important services*)
   - ~~Examples: web servers, file servers, database servers~~
4. Packet sniffing
   - Example: Wireshark
5. Firewalls
   - February 25
   - Local ~~and shared~~ (February 25; just use local)
   - ~~PfSense~~ (on the list because Michael wants to make sure we *don't* use PfSense)
6. ~~DNS â€“ the Domain Name System~~ (February 11-25)
7. Focus on important services
   - Web servers
     - Adding new apps
   - File servers
   - Database servers and queueing services
   - Remote Desktop Server
